NounsMap - disaster photo sharing service

A service which allows users to share photos with a visual location info to Twitter, to share them or get some help.  


# Why?
The Russian invasion of Ukraine proved to us that the SNS is a powerful tool for regular people to share information and request help even during a war. 

Even though it is possible to share photos and videos with location information, it’s not easy to access that information. We want to make it extremely easier for regular people to share location specific information (text, images, videos and sounds) using social networking services, especially Twitter. 

We use Nouns glasses as the indicator of the location, representing "the eyes of people", expecting that this service will position Nouns as a brand which provides real values to the society.

# Plan

We will develop an MVP app (which enables easy photo & nouns post) with 2 EH (engineering cost) within a month. We are going to start with a token-gated, closed beta release to Nouns communities (including various subDAOs, such as Lil Nouns), and open it to the public later.
Note: We may choose to use a more generic icon (pin) for the general public, if we see too many inappropriate pictures, which might hurt Nouns brand – until we come up with a filtering mechanism.  

After we prove that we are able to build such a service, we are going to make another proposal to the Nouns DAO (not prop.house), which includes more features and  map-view of “current disasters”.
